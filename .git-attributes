# Per excellent advice in:

# Set text line endings to LF. This is important when using
# DevContainers on Windows, where the host repository (which uses
# CRLF by default on work tree checkout) is mounted
# in a Linux development environment (which will use only LF). The
# Linux Git will see the additional CRLFs as modifications.

* text=auto eol=lf
*.{cmd,[cC][mM][dD]} text eol=crlf
*.{bat,[bB][aA][tT]} text eol=crlf
